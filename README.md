# Backend-Take-Home-Assignment-Report
This Python-based command-line application fetches research papers from PubMed based on a user-specified query and filters them to identify papers with at least one author affiliated with a non-academic institution (e.g., pharmaceutical or biotech companies). The results are exported into a structured CSV file for easy review and analysis.
